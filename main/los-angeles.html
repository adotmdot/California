        <h2 class="heading2">The Year in Los Angeles was Incorporated</h2>
        <p class="para2">
          Los Angeles was officially incorporated as a city on April 4, 1850. The city's origins trace back much earlier, to September 4, 1781, when a group of 44 settlers, known as "Los Pobladores," established the original settlement under Spanish rule. At the time, it was called "El Pueblo de Nuestra Se√±ora la Reina de los √Ångeles de Porci√∫ncula," which translates to "The Town of Our Lady the Queen of Angels of Porci√∫ncula." <br>

        </p>
    
            
        
        <aside>
<p class="para2">
              During the early 19th century, Los Angeles remained a small town under Spanish and later Mexican rule. However, in 1848, after the Mexican-American War, California became part of the United States through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Just two years later, in 1850, Los Angeles officially became a city, coinciding with California's admission as the 31st state of the U.S.

    </p>
</aside>
    
    <p class="para2">   The incorporation of Los Angeles marked the beginning of its transformation from a modest pueblo into a rapidly growing metropolis. Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the city expanded significantly due to the arrival of railroads, the discovery of oil, and its development as a major economic and cultural hub. Today, Los Angeles stands as the second-largest city in the United States, known worldwide for its entertainment industry, diverse population, and economic influence.
